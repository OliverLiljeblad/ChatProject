Chat Application

This project is a simple chat application designed to demonstrate the fundamentals of networking and multithreaded programming.
Users can run a server and connect multiple clients from their computer to send messages in real-time.

You can run commands to change name /nick "name" or "/quit" to leave as a client

Everytime the program starts, it creates a text file or overwrites existing one. Then it logs the text messages between the clients
